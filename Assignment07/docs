3. In object-oriented programming (OOP), strategy selection works by creating objects that represent different behaviors and then switching which object is used at runtime. 
In functional programming (FP), like in OCaml, strategies are often just functions that you pass around. Instead of creating objects, you give your program a function to use, and it executes that function.

Functions-as-values and objects-as-behaviors are similar because they both let you change what a program does without changing the main code. 
The difference is that objects are bundles of data and methods, while functions are just blocks of code that take input and give output.

OCaml’s modules and functors can work like classes. A module can hold a set of related functions, and a functor can take a module as input and create a new module.
This is similar to how a class can define behavior and then be used to create objects.
Using modules and functors, you can organize your code, swap different implementations, and keep your program flexible, just like using objects in OOP.
